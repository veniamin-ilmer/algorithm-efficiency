# Function Benchmarks
All benchmarks are listed in folders with the naming:

[*subject*]_[*action*]

For example, if you want to find a benchmark for parsing JSON, you would search for the subject JSON, and action parsing, or:

    json_parse

## Contents

Each bench folder will contain a description of the benchmark along with a breakdown of each test run for that benchmark.

There will be a table of benchmark results, along with a separate rs code file for each crate.

If there are any related functions detected, those will be listed.

Finally, for record keeping, the version all crates tested will be posted.

## Searching for Crates

The benchmarks here are purposely built to be function based, rather than crate based, so you cannot directly lookup a specific crate.

However, you might be able to find what you are looking for using Github's search.

Simply go to the top left github search box and type in the crate name.
